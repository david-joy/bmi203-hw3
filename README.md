Skeleton for sequencing project

## Assignment - Part 1

1. Implement Smith-Waterman
    - Implemented in [smith_waterman()](https://github.com/david-joy/bmi203-hw3/blob/master/hw3/alignment.py#L53)
    - Dynamic programming calculation implemented in [_calc_sw_matrix()](https://github.com/david-joy/bmi203-hw3/blob/master/hw3/_alignment.pyx#L6) using Cython for speed
    - Traceback to find longest local alignment in [_calc_sw_traceback()](https://github.com/david-joy/bmi203-hw3/blob/master/hw3/alignment.py#L1)
    - Tests for the algorithm in [test_alignment.py](https://github.com/david-joy/bmi203-hw3/blob/master/test/test_alignment.py)
2. It should be able to use any scoring matrix provided
    - Scoring matrix reader implemented in [read_score_matrix()](https://github.com/david-joy/bmi203-hw3/blob/master/hw3/io.py#L9)

## Questions - Part 1

### Question 1

Consider the false positive rate (proportion of negative pairs with scores that exceed a score threshold) when the true positive rate (proportion of positive pairs with scores above the threshold) is 0.7. What's the best false positive rate that you can achieve with varying both gap opening (from 1 to 20) and extension penalties (from 1 to 5) with the BLOSUM50 matrix? What is the best gap penalty combination?

The scores were calculated by scanning all combinations of gap opening and gap extension penalty in `calc_optimal_blosum50.py`. The plots below were generated by runnning `plot_optimal_blosum50.py`.

Plotting the scores for the true positive rate gives the following distribution of cutoffs:<br />

Using these cutoffs, the false positive rate for the negative pairs is given by the following distribution:<br />

By inspection, there are two optimal levels with a 22% false positive rate:

- Set one:
    - Gap opening: -7
    - Gap extension: -3
- Set two:
    - Gap opening -6
    - Gap extension: -5

The following analysis uses a gap opening of -7 and a gap extension of -3.

### Question 2

Using the gap penalties you determined from question 1, which of the provided scoring matrices performs the best, in terms of false positive rate (at a true positive rate of 0.7)? What are the performance rates of each of the matrices? Create a Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) graph which shows the fraction of true positives on the Y axis and the fraction of false positives on the X axis. Include on the graph data for each of the provided matrices. Please take care to make your ROC graphs square, with both X and Y axes limited to the range [0:1]. Note, you can download ROC code from here: http://www.jainlab.org/Public/ucsf-roc.zip. It is not guaranteed to be bug free but it might save you some time.

### Question 3

How does the performance change if you normalize the Smith-Waterman scores by the length of the shortest sequence in a pair (i.e. divide the raw score by the min length)? Show the ROC curves for your best matrix and for the same matrix with normalized scores. Are the false positive rates better or worse? Why do you think this is so?

## Questions - Part 2

### Question 1

Devise an optimization algorithm to modify the values in a starting score matrix such as to maximize the following objective function: sum of TP rates for FP rates of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The maximum value for the objective function is 4.0 (where you are getting perfect separation of positive and negative pairs even at the lowest false positive rate). You should use the gap and extension penalties derived from Part 1. Remember, you must maintain symmetry in your matrix. You can make use of real-valued scores in the matrices if desired (this is probably a good idea).

### Question 2

Beginning from the best matrix from above (that which produced the alignments), run your optimization algorithm to maximize the fitness of the new matrix. How much improvement do you see in the fitness? Show the full ROC curves for the original matrix and the optimized matrix. What happens when you now realign the sequences using the new matrix and rescore? Show the new ROC curve following realignment on the same graph as above. Qualitatively discuss how your matrix and your alignments change following optimization.

### Question 3

Beginning from the MATIO matrix, but using the same initial sequence alignments, re-run the optimization. Show the same ROC plots as for (2). Discuss the relationship between the results you see here and the results you saw for (2).

### Question 4

Describe your optimization algorithm briefly. How might you improve it?

### Question 5

What would be required in order to make a convincing case that an optimized matrix will be of general utility and will actually be beneficial for people to use in searching databases?

## structure

The main algorithm for Smith-Waterman is implemented in `alignment.py` with a Cythonized implementation of dynamic programming in `_alignment.pyx` for speed. Code for reading and writing files is in `io.py`.
